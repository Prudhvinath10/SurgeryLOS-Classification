# 🏥 Surgery Length of Stay Prediction

**Leveraging Machine Learning to Predict Post-Surgery Length of Stay**

This repository contains our final project for the UT ORIE Summer 2024 Applied Projects. Our goal? Predict how long a patient will stay in the hospital after surgery, based on data available either **before** or **after** surgery. This could help hospitals assign inpatient/outpatient status more intelligently—without relying on a stethoscope and a dream.

---

## 📌 Objective

Develop robust ML models to predict **Post-Surgery Length of Stay (LOS)** into 4 discrete categories using structured surgical data. Our mission: optimize hospital capacity by forecasting how long patients will hang out in recovery, from **pre-op data** to **post-op insights**.

## 🧠 What We Did

- 🧽 **Outlier Detection** with flexible IQR filtering (1.0–3.0)
- 🤕 **Missing Value Imputation**:
  - *Numerical*: Median by groups like Age Bucket, Sex, Service
  - *Categorical*: Mode fill, 'Unknown' handling
- 📊 **Feature Engineering & Dropping** of redundant or sparsely populated features
- 📦 **One-Hot Encoding** to convert categorical features into 6000+ columns of pure regret
- 🧮 **Model Training**:
  - Random Forest Classifier (RFC)
  - XGBoost (XGB)
- 🧪 **Model Evaluation**: Accuracy, Recall, Precision, F1-Score, Cross-Validation
- 🔍 **Feature Selection**: Forward & Backward Selection to reduce dimensionality
- 💡 **Explainability**: SHAP analysis to see what features actually mattered
